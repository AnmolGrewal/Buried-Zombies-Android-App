    <string name="helpParagraph"> Your goal in this game is to find all the zombies buried under the gravestones.\n
                Also you want to reach your goal with the least number of scans possible\n
                You click on a gravestone with a zombie that you have already discovered or a\n
                gravestone that you clicked but turns out to not have a zombie to commence a scan of the\n
                row and column of that particular gravestone to tell you how many zombies there are.\n
                Good Luck!\n
